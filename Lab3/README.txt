For the first additional personas louis, he is a young programmer and he loves more modern and cool website. 
So I changed the navigational pattern from "Tab" into "Collapse Sidebar"in order to make the website has a more modern appearance.

For the other additional personas John, he is a student who wants to get student discount to save money. 
So I added a student discount function which allow student users to enter their student number and get student disscount. 
The total price in Cart will get a 10% disscount for student users.

Other changes are
1. Changed the font type and increased font size of body and button.
2. Changed the background picture of whole website.
3. Changed the choice of word of the button "Client" in Lab 2 design to "Personal Preference".
4. Changed the sentence "Choose a preference for organic products or not" to "Would you want to choose only organic products?".
5. Changed the style and word of "Confirm The Choice" button and style of "Add selected items to cart" button. The font type and font size of two buttons is changed for a clearer visual effects.
6. Changed the words in "Choose a Category" list from "lactoseIntolerant" and "nutAllergies" to "Lactose Free" and "Nut Free".
